WebGUI assignment

These solutions are based on the Inspired Testing – QA Automaon Assessment which instructed me to test the functionality of Way2Automate's website (http://www.way2automation.com/angularjs-protractor/banking/#/login) and API Rest Service testing on (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

I created both solutions using eclipse version: 2020-12 (4.18.0), build id: 20201210-1552 in a single project. I have used Maven and Testng-7.3.0 as my underlying test automation frameworks and or test build tools.
I have opted to do a Java / Selenium  based project for Web testing and for API testing I used Java / RestAssured (library). You will find the web automation test scripts in "/inspiredtesting/src/test/java/omf/test/CustomerActions.java" and the API test scripts in "/inspiredtesting/src/test/java/omf/test/API.java". I have also used, Enumerables, helperObjects, pageObjects, Utilities which you will see in the project structure as well.

Below you will see some of the major softwares with their respective versions that I have used and which you will need in order to successfully execute the test scripts:

Tools used:
	selenium-server-standalone-3.11.0 
	chromedriver.exe win32
	Java 1.8.0_201
	RestAssured 3.1.1
    Github for my source repository

Operating System
	Wndows 10 64 bit processor
	
Browsers Installed on machine 
	Chrome 88.0.4324.104 (Official Build) (64-bit))
	
	Dependencies (libraries/drivers) are in the "dependencies" folder and in the POM Maven file.

How to run the tests:
Assuming you are using eclipse and after setting up the project which should not be much as all dependencies have been included. Right click on the testng.xml file that is at the very bottom of the project explorer window on your left hand side. Hover over "Run as", then click "1 TestNG Suite", both suites should now run on your side.
